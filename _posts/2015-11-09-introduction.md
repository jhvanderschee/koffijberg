Heavy with confidence, I would deposit my lumbering frame in the middle of the room. My choice to go all static had been a good one. It was quite a serene scenery—nothing could touch me.

There were website owners running around wildly, chasing WordPress security vulnerabilities, while at the same time trying to plug holes, which the dubious free plug-ins they downloaded had ripped into their very essence. I saw a man standing at the window and bashing his head against it in a slow rhythmic pace. This wasn’t a medical condition. He was simply repeating the rate at which his PHP-based and database-driven publishing solution would accept new requests.

From the corner of my eye I could make out a woman who was frantically flailing her arms about. She was trying to get into the room. Unfortunately, no one would let her in—her website had been infected with malware and whenever someone tried to visit it, there was a warning, urging users to run away as fast as they could.

Static publishing, oh blissful serenity. Why do I like you so much?
